# Contributing

## Tracking work

- Start in separate sections for now
- Later, create and assign issues and sub-issues as needed to avoid overlap

## Doing work

- Favor use of the web editor for now to keep things simple
- Paste or drag-and-drop images to leverage the GitHub `user-attachment` feature
- Focus on migrating Solutions content for now; try to avoid new decisions
- Keep page hierarchy as flat as possible, but use logical structure as needed
- Defer "special case" pages for now; will collaborate on those when we're ready

## Reviewing work

- Create PRs to add new work
- Have at least one other person look it over
- Anyone can merge when ready
- Please delete (remote) branches after merge
- OK to commit directly to main for small edits/typos
